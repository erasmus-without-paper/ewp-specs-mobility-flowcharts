Release notes
=============

This document describes all the changes made to the *EWP Mobility Process
Explained* document, starting from its first released version.


Version 0.2.1
-------------

* Added a note, that partners are not required to implement all features of the
  mobility timeline (e.g. they can implement nominations only).


Version 0.2.0
-------------

The document has been completely rewritten (as part of [this issue]
(https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-mobility-flowcharts/issues/5)).
This new design [covers](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-wp4-use-cases)
WP2's use cases, but it hasn't been officially accepted yet. Once it is
accepted, it will be released as `v1.0.0`.


Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial draft release.

This version hasn't been accepted nor reviewed by any partner, it's a snapshot
of a work in progress. We're assigning a version number to this particular
snapshot, because it has been briefly presented on a workshop in Brussels (it
might be easier to refer to it if it has a version number).
