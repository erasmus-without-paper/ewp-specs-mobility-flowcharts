Release notes
=============

This document describes all the changes made to the *EWP Mobility Process
Explained* document, starting from its first released version.


0.5.1
-----

* Fix wording to mention approval notifications.


0.5.0
-----

**Major update of almost all chapters.**

See comments to version 0.4.0. Again, lots have changed in the APIs since last version.


0.4.0
-----

**Major update of almost all chapters.**

Lots have changed in the APIs since version 0.3.0 of this document was
released. There's no point in reiterating all the changes here - try reviewing
Git's diff instead (or simply read the new version of the document).


0.3.1
-----

* Just added a warning that the current version of this document is a bit
  obsolete in places, and that the reader should keep this mind while reading.
  (We plan to update the document thoroughly after all APIs are stable.)


0.3.0
-----

* It now describes the newer versions of the IIA-related APIs (see
  [here](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/general-issues/issues/12#issuecomment-231486102)).
  The workflow related to handling IIAs was significantly changed.

* The "General Workflow" section has been split into two sections:
  "Introduction to Mobilities" and "Migrating from other workflows". The latter
  one has also been moved to the end of the document.

* Minor changes and updates to all sections.


0.2.1
-----

* Added a note, that partners are not required to implement all features of the
  mobility timeline (e.g. they can implement nominations only).


0.2.0
-----

The document has been completely rewritten (as part of
[this issue](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-mobility-flowcharts/issues/5)).
This new design [covers](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-wp4-use-cases)
WP2's use cases, but it hasn't been officially accepted yet. Once it is
accepted, it will be released as `v1.0.0`.


0.1.0
-----

Initial draft release.

This version hasn't been accepted nor reviewed by any partner, it's a snapshot
of a work in progress. We're assigning a version number to this particular
snapshot, because it has been briefly presented on a workshop in Brussels (it
might be easier to refer to it if it has a version number).
